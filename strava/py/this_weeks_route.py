DESCRIPTION = "This week we are going to try and run a route that we usually only do in the summer months for lighting purposes. But hopefully the expected snowfall and almost full moon will brighten up the trail. <br /> If possible, bring a headlamp for this one and be prepared to go slow as we run through the snow! <br />As always, we meet at the Sullivans Pond Gazebo at 6:30pm."
