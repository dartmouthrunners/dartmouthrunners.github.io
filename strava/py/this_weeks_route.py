DESCRIPTION = "This week we will try another new route that is sure to be a leg burner. <br />We will make our way up the lake and then start climbing Celtic Dr. It is one of those hills that just when you think you've hit the top, there is a little bit left! Then we'll coast back down via Portland Street, all the way to Ochterloney and back to the Gazebo.<br />As always, we meet at the Sullivans Pond Gazebo at 6:30pm."
