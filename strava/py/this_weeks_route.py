DESCRIPTION = "This week we will run an older route that we haven't done in a while! <br />First we will make the climb up Maple and head all the way down Slayter until we hit Albro Lake Rd. From there we will make our way to Lancaster, then Mic Mac Blvd, and finally back to the gazebo via Crichton Ave. <br />As always, we meet at the Sullivans Pond Gazebo at 6:30pm."
