Once we hit Victoria Rd we'll start to engage those butt muscles by climbing Victoria, then Thistle, and finally Forest Road. <br />Once we've hit the summit, we'll make our way back to the pond via Lyngby and Crichton. <br />As always, we meet at the Sullivans Pond Gazebo at 6:30pm.", "date": "January 17, 2019"}
